## Lovis Schultze


I'm this German dude, rationalist and effective altruist who came to London to make the world a better place. I finished Gymnasium (German equivalent of High School) 2 years ago, went to Uni and decided that there has to be a faster way to make an impact, that's why I did Makers Academy last year. I want to be one of the best developers on this planet, so I'm looking for a healthy environment where I can grow, high and fast.

## Skills

### Coding 

I'm still beginner level but I can and will learn fast, and I won't do that for you, I will do that for me.

### Rationality
